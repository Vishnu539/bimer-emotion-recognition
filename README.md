# BiMER – Bimodal Emotion Recognition System

A bimodal emotion recognition framework that analyzes **speech and text** to predict human emotions using modern transformer-based models.

This project implements a multimodal emotion recognition system combining **Wav2Vec 2.0 for speech emotion recognition** and **RoBERTa for text emotion recognition**, with a **late fusion strategy** to produce the final prediction.

The system is designed to operate under three scenarios:

* Speech-only emotion recognition
* Text-only emotion recognition
* Bimodal emotion recognition (speech + text)

By combining complementary cues from acoustic signals and linguistic content, the system improves overall emotion classification performance.

# Project Overview

Emotion recognition plays a critical role in **affective computing** and **human–computer interaction**. Humans express emotions through multiple modalities such as speech tone, facial expressions, and textual language. Relying on a single modality often leads to incomplete interpretation of emotional states.

This project introduces a **bimodal emotion recognition system** that processes speech and text independently and combines their predictions at the decision stage using a **late fusion strategy**.

The system leverages transformer-based models to capture emotional cues from both modalities:

* **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** using Wav2Vec 2.0
* **Text Emotion Recognition (TER)** using RoBERTa

The final emotion prediction is obtained by integrating the outputs of both models.
Experimental evaluation on the **IEMOCAP dataset** shows that combining speech and text improves overall classification accuracy compared to unimodal approaches.

# Key Features

* Bimodal emotion recognition using **speech and text**
* Transformer-based models for both modalities
* Modular architecture allowing **speech-only, text-only, or combined inference**
* Late fusion strategy for prediction integration
* Evaluation on the **IEMOCAP emotion dataset**
* Implementation using **PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers**

---

# System Architecture

The framework consists of two independent processing branches:

### Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

* Input: Raw speech waveform
* Encoder: **Wav2Vec 2.0**
* Feature extraction from raw audio
* Classification head predicts emotion probabilities

### Text Emotion Recognition (TER)

* Input: Text transcripts
* Encoder: **RoBERTa**
* Contextual representation learning
* Classification layer produces emotion prediction scores

### Fusion Mechanism

The outputs of the two models are combined using a **late fusion strategy at the logit level**.
This approach preserves modularity while allowing both modalities to contribute to the final prediction.

The architecture processes speech and text independently before integrating their prediction scores to determine the final emotion label.

# Emotion Classes

The system predicts four emotion categories:

* Angry
* Happy
* Sad
* Neutral

These categories are commonly used in emotion recognition research based on the IEMOCAP dataset.

---

# Dataset

The system is evaluated using the **Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset**, a widely used benchmark for multimodal emotion recognition research.

The dataset contains conversational recordings from professional actors with annotated emotional labels and corresponding text transcripts. 

### Dataset Statistics

| Emotion | Utterances |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Angry   | 1147       |
| Happy   | 1807       |
| Sad     | 1110       |
| Neutral | 1790       |
| Total   | 5854       |

The dataset is split using a **speaker-independent setup**:

* Sessions 1–4 → Training
* Session 5 → Testing

This ensures the model generalizes to unseen speakers during evaluation.

# Model Configuration

| Component        | Model                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Speech Encoder   | Wav2Vec 2.0            |
| Text Encoder     | RoBERTa-base           |
| Fusion Strategy  | Late Fusion            |
| Loss Function    | Weighted Cross Entropy |
| Speech Optimizer | Adam                   |
| Text Optimizer   | AdamW                  |

Training is performed independently for speech and text models, while fusion is applied during inference.

# Experimental Results

| Model                   | Accuracy  |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Speech-only             | 54.8%     |
| Text-only               | 68.9%     |
| Bimodal (Speech + Text) | **72.0%** |

The results demonstrate that combining speech and text improves classification accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
